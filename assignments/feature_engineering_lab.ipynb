For the first three, determine the features to add in order to best fit the data.  You'll know you've got it when the boundary is drawn appropriately.  Refer back to examples in the Polynomial Regression notebook for help.  The final two exercises are ungraded bonuses.  I imagine most people will skip them, but feel free to try to take on the challenge!"

The goal here is to create a regression with horsepower as the response.  For now, only use numerical columns as your features.  Specifically, you are to do the following:\n",
